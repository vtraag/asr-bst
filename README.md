This repository contains an updated version of `asr.bst`, of which a previous copy can be found at <http://people.ku.edu/~chkim/etc/asr.bst>. This bibliography style is meant to follow the general American Sociological Association (ASA) style guide.

This repository not only contains an `asr.bst`, but also the `asr.dbj` that can be used to generate the `asr.bst`. This `asr.dbj` contains relevant configuration options. The file `asr.bst` can be generated by running `tex asr.dbj`.

One particular changes that this style provides is that it allows referencing arXiv papers. Please note that this style guide includes clickable URLs in PDFs, and assumes that the `hyperref` package is loaded.

If you encounter any problem, or would you like to change something to this style, feel free to open an issue. Or you can of course take the style and change it according to your own wishes.
